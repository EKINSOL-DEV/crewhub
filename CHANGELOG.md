### 🔧 Fixes
- **Double render on load** — Fingerprint-based deduplication prevents visible flash on page load
- **Chat windows for non-fixed bots** — Chat only opens for fixed agents (agent:*:main)
- **Camera initial position** — Correct position on mount without animation
- **Bot fixed Y height** — BOT_FIXED_Y = 0.35 constant, never influenced by geometry
- **Wandering bounds** — Campus-only with 3-unit margin and clampToCampus() safety net
- **Room click crash** — React hooks violation in RoomNameplate.tsx fixed
- **Wall-grid alignment** — WALL_THICKNESS = 0.3 matching RoomWalls.tsx
- **Camera zoom-2 angle** — No 180° rotation on room focus
- **Agent picker scrollbar** — Dropdown centering and scroll fixes

### ⚡ Performance
- **Environment optimization** — Instanced meshes, distance culling, larger tiles
- **Double render prevention** — Fingerprint dedup in useSessionsStream, RoomsContext, useAgentsRegistry, useProjects

### 📦 Other
- Database schema v8 (floor_style, wall_style, agent bio)
- Bot scale increased 30%
- 3D room nameplates redesigned from Text3D to floating HTML billboards

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-05

### 🌟 New Features
- **Modding foundation: Registry\<T\> pattern** — Generic registry with namespaced IDs (`namespace:id`), batch registration, and Zod validation
- **Data-driven props** — Props defined as JSON data instead of hardcoded components, with PropRegistry split into 5 focused modules
- **Blueprint system** — Room blueprints as JSON with import/export API and validation
- **Data-driven environments** — Environment configurations loaded from data files
- **Blueprint import/export API** — Full API for sharing and validating blueprints
- **Starlight documentation site** — Dedicated docs site for CrewHub modding and architecture

### ⚡ Performance
- **Centralized SSE** — Single Server-Sent Events connection shared across components
- **RoomsContext** — Shared room state to prevent redundant fetches
- **AbortController** — Proper request cancellation on unmount

### 📦 Other
- Batch registration support for registries
- Zod schema validation for all registry entries
- PropRegistry refactored from monolith into 5 modules

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-04

- **Composite props & stale paths** — Fixed desk+monitor overwriting each other, safe pathfinding fallback, stale path clearing (`d80aa53`)
- **Props floating in air** — Correct Y-positioning per mount type (floor/wall), wall placement, boundary clamping (`27e6fb3`, `7651840`)
- **Routing rules duplication** — Use fixed IDs instead of uuid4, cleaned 110 duplicate rules on backend restart (`651b777`)
