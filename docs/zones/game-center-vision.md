# 🎮 Game Center — Zone Vision Document

*Where code meets play, experiments run wild, and the impossible gets prototyped.*

## Vision

The Game Center is CrewHub's experimental playground — an arcade-meets-laboratory where agents build 3D experiences, prototype game mechanics, run simulations, and push the boundaries of what's possible in Three.js. It's equal parts dev lab and funhouse.

**Vibe:** High energy, playful, slightly retro-futuristic. Neon arcade cabinets next to cutting-edge 3D workstations. The kind of place where someone is always testing something crazy in the corner, and the walls literally react to what's being built.

**Who works here:** Game Dev (3D/Three.js specialist), any agent working on 3D features, simulations, or interactive experiences.

## Environment

### Visual Style
- **Color palette:** Deep indigo and cyan with hot pink and electric green neon accents
- **Lighting:** Low ambient + heavy neon glow. Think cyberpunk arcade at night
- **Floor:** Dark metallic grid with subtle glow lines running between tiles (TRON-style)
- **Walls:** Dark panels with embedded LED strips that pulse in patterns. Pixel art murals on feature walls
- **Ceiling:** Low, industrial, with hanging neon tubes and holographic displays
- **Ambient particles:** Tiny pixel-like squares that float and fade — like digital confetti

### Atmosphere Details
- The entrance is a literal portal frame — a glowing archway with particle effects
- Arcade sound effects play softly in the background (coin drops, power-ups, chiptune melodies)
- One wall is a massive pixel art mural of the CrewHub campus, made of actual interactive pixels
- Floor tiles light up when agents walk over them (like a dance pad)
- A scoreboard above the entrance shows "HIGH SCORES" — actually tracks real agent achievements

## Rooms

### 1. 🕹️ The Arcade
A retro arcade room filled with cabinet machines, each representing a different CrewHub mini-game or demo.

- **Purpose:** Showcasing completed demos, testing interactive features, fun/morale
- **Key prop:** A row of arcade cabinets with glowing screens — each runs a different demo
- **Bot position:** Off-duty agents hang out here
- **Detail:** Each cabinet has a joystick and buttons that glow. The screens show actual Three.js mini-scenes
- **Easter egg:** One cabinet is "OUT OF ORDER" with a sticky note: "Quarters only. We don't accept crypto."

### 2. 🔬 The 3D Lab
A high-tech workspace with multiple screens showing wireframes, shader graphs, and 3D viewports.

- **Purpose:** Three.js development, shader writing, 3D model creation, performance testing
- **Key prop:** A holographic display table showing a rotating 3D model (current project)
- **Bot position:** Game Dev's primary workspace
- **Detail:** The walls display real-time render stats (FPS, draw calls, triangle count) as floating HUD elements
- **On the desk:** A rubber duck wearing VR goggles (debugging companion)

### 3. 🏟️ The Arena
An open circular room with a flat floor that can transform into any 3D scene — the testing ground.

- **Purpose:** Live testing of 3D scenes, physics experiments, multiplayer prototypes
- **Key prop:** A raised platform in the center where 3D scenes materialize
- **Detail:** The Arena floor is a grid that morphs to match whatever's being tested — grass for outdoor scenes, metal for sci-fi, etc.
- **Spectator seating:** Tiered seats around the edges for other agents to watch demos

### 4. 🎨 Shader Forge
A dark, moody room lit entirely by the glow of shader previews on multiple screens.

- **Purpose:** GLSL shader development, material creation, visual effects R&D
- **Key prop:** A massive screen showing a rotating sphere with the current shader applied
- **Detail:** Color palette strips along the walls morph based on the shader being worked on
- **Vibe:** The most "hacker cave" room in all of CrewHub — intentionally dark and focused

### 5. 📦 Asset Workshop
A maker-space style room with a 3D printer prop, model turntables, and organized shelves of 3D assets.

- **Purpose:** 3D model creation, asset optimization, texture painting, prop building
- **Key prop:** A 3D printer that "prints" new models with a laser build-up animation
- **Detail:** Shelves display miniature versions of all CrewHub props — like a trophy case of everything built
- **Turntable:** A central rotating platform showing the latest model, with wireframe overlay toggle

### 6. 🎲 The Sandbox
A deliberately chaotic room — half playground, half physics experiment gone wrong.

- **Purpose:** Free experimentation, physics testing, "what if" prototypes, easter egg development
- **Key prop:** Everything in this room has physics enabled — things bounce, roll, stack, collapse
- **Detail:** Deliberately messy — blocks stacked precariously, balls rolling around, a Newton's cradle that never stops
- **Hidden:** A tiny door in the wall (mouse-sized) that leads to a miniature version of the entire Game Center

## The Demo Showcase (Rotating Arcade)

### How It Works
- Each arcade cabinet can host a self-contained Three.js demo
- Demos are registered via the Blueprint system
- New demos appear as new cabinets in the Arcade
- "HIGH SCORE" leaderboard tracks which demos are most viewed/interacted with

### Built-in Demos (Ideas)
1. **Bot Customizer** — Dress up CrewHub bots with accessories, change colors, expressions
2. **Room Designer** — Drag-and-drop room layout tool with live 3D preview
3. **Shader Playground** — Interactive shader editor with instant preview
4. **Physics Sandbox** — Drop objects, build structures, add forces, watch chaos
5. **Speedrun** — Navigate through all CrewHub zones as fast as possible
6. **Pixel Art Editor** — Create pixel art that can be displayed on the pixel mural wall

## Future Ideas

### 🚀 Near-Term (v0.12-v0.14)
- **Live Development Preview:** The holographic table actually shows the WIP 3D scene from the current dev branch
- **Performance Dashboard:** Real-time FPS/memory stats for the actual CrewHub 3D world, displayed in the Lab
- **Asset Preview Carousel:** Rotating display of all registered props with metadata

### 🌟 Mid-Term
- **Multiplayer Testing Ground:** Multiple agents in the Arena simultaneously, each controlling a bot in a test scene
- **Shader Library:** A browsable collection of all custom shaders, organized in the Forge with preview spheres
- **Procedural Generation Lab:** A room dedicated to procedural content — terrain, buildings, vegetation
- **VR Preview Room:** A room that simulates what CrewHub would look like in VR (within the 3D world, meta!)
- **Replay System:** Record and replay 3D scenes/interactions for debugging and demo purposes
- **Benchmark Suite:** Automated performance testing that runs through all environments and reports results

### 🔮 Far-Future (Dream Big!)
- **Metaverse Bridge:** Connect the Game Center to external 3D worlds or WebXR experiences
- **AI-Assisted 3D Modeling:** Describe a prop in text, watch it materialize on the 3D printer in real-time
- **Game Jam Events:** Timed events where agents compete to build the best demo in 24 hours
- **Procedural Music Engine:** The background music adapts to what's being built — calm for modeling, intense for performance testing, glitchy for debugging
- **Crowd Simulation Lab:** Test AI behavior with thousands of tiny bots in the Arena
- **Digital Twin Room:** Import real-world spaces as 3D scans and walk through them
- **Cross-Zone Quests:** Story-driven missions that start in the Game Center and require visiting other zones to complete

### 🎭 Fun & Quirky Ideas
- **Patch Notes Board:** A bulletin board that shows actual git commit messages from 3D-related PRs — the good, the bad, and the "why did this ever work?"
- **The Rage Room:** A small padded room where you can launch objects at walls when a bug won't die — physics-enabled, deeply satisfying
- **Bot Battle Arena:** Agents can challenge each other to simple bot vs bot competitions in the Arena
- **Time Lapse Gallery:** A wall showing time-lapse replays of complex 3D scenes being built, step by step
- **The Hall of Shame:** A tiny museum of the worst bugs ever found — each displayed in a glass case with a plaque describing the horror
- **Confetti Cannon:** When a major 3D feature ships, a cannon in the Arena fires confetti across the entire Game Center
- **Speed Run Timer:** A visible timer that starts when Game Dev enters the Lab and stops when code is committed — tracking the fastest bug fix
- **The Glitch Zone:** An intentionally broken corner of the room where textures flicker, models clip through each other, and normals are inverted — "art installation" celebrating the bugs we've conquered
