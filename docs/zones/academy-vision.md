# 🎓 Academy — Zone Vision Document

*Where knowledge flows, skills grow, and every agent levels up.*

## Vision

The Academy is CrewHub's knowledge hub — a sprawling campus-style zone where agents learn, share expertise, build documentation, and train new team members. Imagine a blend between Hogwarts' Great Library, a modern co-working university, and a cozy coding bootcamp — all in toon-shaded glory.

**Vibe:** Warm, scholarly, but approachable. Not stuffy or intimidating — think "cool professor's office" rather than "corporate training center." Books everywhere, chalkboards with diagrams, and the quiet hum of collective learning.

**Who works here:** WTL (Waterleau knowledge agent), any agent doing research, documentation, or onboarding tasks.

---

## Environment

### Visual Style
- **Color palette:** Warm amber and forest green with gold accents
- **Lighting:** Soft golden hour light streaming through tall windows, desk lamps with green banker shades
- **Floor:** Polished dark wood with occasional area rugs in the reading spaces
- **Walls:** Rich wood paneling on lower half, cream plaster on upper, with built-in bookshelves
- **Ceiling:** Vaulted with exposed wooden beams and hanging brass chandeliers
- **Ambient particles:** Floating dust motes caught in sunlight beams (very subtle, very cozy)

### Atmosphere Details
- A grand arched entrance with "ACADEMY" carved in stone above the doorway
- An old-fashioned globe that slowly rotates on a stand near the entrance
- Ivy creeping up the exterior walls (visible from outside)
- A grandfather clock that shows actual time — its pendulum swings gently
- Stained glass window behind the main lecture area casting colored light patterns on the floor

## Rooms

### 1. 📚 The Great Library
The centerpiece of the Academy — a two-story room with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, rolling ladders, and reading nooks.

- **Purpose:** Knowledge base, documentation storage, research
- **Key prop:** A massive oak desk with a glowing open book (the "Index") — click to search docs
- **Bot position:** WTL's primary workspace, sitting at the research desk
- **Detail:** Books on shelves are actually organized by project/topic — zoom in and you can read tiny spine labels
- **Secret:** One bookshelf section is a hidden door (pull the red book!) leading to the Archive

### 2. 🏛️ Lecture Hall
A tiered amphitheater-style room with a stage, podium, and projection screen.

- **Purpose:** Presentations, knowledge sharing, team briefings, onboarding
- **Key prop:** A floating holographic display above the podium (shows current presentation topic)
- **Detail:** Seats have tiny name plaques for regular attendees. Empty seats = agents in other zones
- **Easter egg:** The podium has a hidden "applause" button

### 3. 🧪 Research Lab
A modern workspace with multiple screens, data visualizations, and a "evidence board" with connected threads.

- **Purpose:** Deep research, competitive analysis, data exploration
- **Key prop:** A detective-style evidence board with red string connecting topics
- **Bot position:** Research-focused agents work here
- **Detail:** A microscope on the desk — purely decorative, but it has a glow animation when research is active

### 4. ✍️ Documentation Workshop
A clean, well-organized room focused on writing and structuring knowledge.

- **Purpose:** Writing docs, README files, architecture docs, wiki pages
- **Key prop:** A typewriter that animates when docs are being generated
- **Detail:** A "Docs Published" counter on the wall, like a factory safety sign: "This workshop has gone [X] days without a typo"
- **Shelves:** Filled with neatly labeled binders representing completed documentation

### 5. 🌱 The Greenhouse (Mentoring Room)
A glass-walled conservatory filled with plants — a relaxed space for 1-on-1 mentoring.

- **Purpose:** Onboarding new agents, 1-on-1 knowledge transfer, skill development
- **Key prop:** Two comfortable armchairs facing each other with a small table between them
- **Detail:** Plants in this room actually "grow" based on mentoring activity — more sessions = lusher plants
- **Metaphor:** Knowledge is a garden. This room makes it literal.

### 6. 🗄️ The Archive (Hidden Room)
Accessed via the secret bookshelf door in the Library. A dimly lit vault with filing cabinets and old maps.

- **Purpose:** Historical data, archived projects, lessons learned, post-mortems
- **Key prop:** An old map table with scrollable project timelines
- **Detail:** Dusty atmosphere, cobwebs in corners, a single flickering lamp — feels like discovering ancient knowledge
- **Easter egg:** A crystal ball on a pedestal that shows random "predictions" (actually inspirational quotes about learning)

- **Sorting Hat:** On a shelf in the Lecture Hall — click it and it "assigns" you to a random CrewHub zone with a dramatic announcement
- **Time Turner:** Hidden in the Archive — clicking it shows a random memory/log entry from the past
- **Secret Passage Map:** A framed map in the hallway that reveals hidden connections between zones when hovered
- **The Oracle Fish:** A fishbowl on WTL's desk — the fish swims toward the side of the bowl that represents the "answer" (left = yes, right = no, middle = maybe)

## The Knowledge Graph (Signature Feature)

The Academy's unique mechanic: a **living knowledge graph** that grows as agents document and research.

### How It Works
- Every document created adds a **node** to the graph
- Related documents are connected with **edges**
- The graph is visualized as a constellation on the Library ceiling
- Brighter stars = more referenced/useful documents
- Clicking a star shows the document summary

### Visual Implementation
```
   ★ Waterleau Architecture
  / \
 ★   ★ MQTT Setup ←→ ★ Data Pipeline
 |       |
 ★ Edge Config   ★ Kafka Topics
```

The ceiling of the Great Library becomes a living star map of organizational knowledge. As more docs are written, more stars appear. Clusters of related knowledge form visible constellations.

**Easter egg:** If you stare at the ceiling long enough (hover for 10 seconds), a shooting star crosses the sky.

## Future Ideas

### 🚀 Near-Term (v0.12-v0.14)
- **Smart Bookshelf:** Bookshelves that actually reflect real documentation structure from the repo
- **Study Groups:** Visual indicator when multiple agents are researching the same topic
- **Doc Health Dashboard:** A room display showing documentation coverage, staleness, and gaps

### 🌟 Mid-Term
- **Interactive Tutorials:** Step-by-step guided tours for new agents, with the Greenhouse room as the starting point
- **Knowledge Duels:** Two agents debate approaches to a problem — displayed as a split-screen in the Lecture Hall
- **Citation Network:** Click any document and see what references it and what it references — like academic papers
- **Reading Lists:** Curated collections of docs that agents can "assign" to each other
- **Office Hours:** Scheduled times when specific agents are "available" in the Greenhouse for questions

### 🔮 Far-Future (Dream Big!)
- **AI Librarian NPC:** A non-agent character that lives in the Library and helps navigate knowledge — like a quest NPC
- **Knowledge Archaeology:** Dig through archived projects to rediscover forgotten insights — visualized as an actual archaeological dig site in the basement
- **Cross-Zone Study Abroad:** Agents can temporarily "enroll" in another zone's Academy branch to learn cross-domain skills
- **The Debate Chamber:** A formal room where agents argue different approaches with structured turn-taking — audience votes on the winner
- **Memory Palace:** A VR-inspired room where knowledge is spatially organized — walk through a virtual building where each room contains different knowledge domains
- **Wisdom Well:** A well in the courtyard that you can "drop a question into" — it percolates and returns an answer later (async research queue, beautifully visualized)

### 🎭 Fun & Quirky Ideas
- **Exam Week:** Periodic "tests" where agents are quizzed on documentation they've written — generates fun reports
- **Late Return Fees:** Documents checked out from the Library that haven't been updated in >30 days get a little "overdue" stamp
- **Book Club:** Agents can "recommend" documents to each other — shows as a shared reading list in the Greenhouse
- **The Owl:** A small animated owl that sits on different bookshelves — it hoots softly when new knowledge is added. It's the Academy's unofficial mascot
- **Graduation Ceremony:** When an agent levels up in the Scholar system, a brief ceremony animation plays in the Lecture Hall (confetti, music, diploma)
- **Quote of the Day:** The chalkboard shows a rotating inspirational quote about learning — sourced from a curated list, maybe even contributed by team members
