# 🎓 Academy — Zone Vision Document

*Where knowledge flows like water, and every lesson opens a new door.*

## Vision

The Academy is CrewHub's temple of learning — a warm, scholarly campus where agents level up their skills, share knowledge, and grow together. Think Hogwarts meets a Silicon Valley bootcamp, wrapped in toon-shaded charm.

**Vibe:** Warm wood tones, soft golden light, the quiet hum of focus. A place that says "you belong here, and you're about to get smarter." Cozy but ambitious.

**Core philosophy:** Learning is social, continuous, and should feel rewarding. Every skill learned is a badge earned. Every knowledge shared strengthens the whole team.

## Environment

### Toon-Shaded Aesthetic
- **Color palette:** Warm oak browns, forest greens, gold accents, deep burgundy highlights
- **Lighting:** Golden hour — warm ambient light from tall windows, desk lamps with green banker shades, floating lanterns in study areas
- **Floor:** Polished wood parquet in lecture rooms, stone tiles in the library, grass paths between buildings
- **Walls:** Stone and wood paneling, with bookshelves embedded in walls everywhere
- **Exterior:** Ivy-covered buildings, a clock tower (shows real time!), cobblestone paths

### Atmosphere Details
- Floating book particles — tiny open books drift in the air near the library
- Knowledge wisps: glowing orbs that trail behind agents who just completed a lesson
- A massive ancient tree in the courtyard (the "Knowledge Tree") that grows leaves as the team learns
- Chalkboard equations that solve themselves as background animation
- Occasional owl prop that hoots when someone earns a badge

## Rooms

### 📚 The Grand Library
**Purpose:** Knowledge base, documentation, reference materials
- Towering bookshelves (3 stories high, with rolling ladders)
- Reading nooks with comfy chairs and floating reading lights
- Card catalog cabinet (interactive — search through knowledge base)
- Globe prop that spins to show project locations
- Secret section behind a bookcase (pull the red book!) → leads to **The Vault**
- **Easter egg:** Find the book titled "How to Train Your Bot" → unlocks a mini tutorial

### 🏫 Lecture Hall
**Purpose:** Presentations, demos, knowledge sharing sessions
- Amphitheater seating (semi-circular)
- Main stage with podium and large projection screen
- Chalkboard that auto-fills with the current topic
- Laser pointer prop (follows the presenting agent's focus)
- Applause particles when a presentation ends
- **Easter egg:** Sit in the back row → "I'm just here for the snacks" thought bubble

### 🧪 Lab
**Purpose:** Experimentation, prototyping, testing new ideas
- Workbenches with tools and equipment
- Bubbling beakers and test tubes (decorative, but they change color based on test results)
- Whiteboard with experiment hypotheses
- Safety goggles rack by the door
- "Eureka meter" on the wall that fills up with successful experiments
- **Easter egg:** Mix the wrong beakers → harmless cartoon explosion with a "oops!" cloud

### 🧘 Study Pods
**Purpose:** Deep focus, individual learning, skill practice
- 4 individual pods with curved walls for privacy
- Each pod has a personal screen and ambient sound selector
- Focus timer displayed as a sand hourglass (3D, sand actually flows!)
- Productivity plant that grows during focused sessions, wilts if interrupted
- **Easter egg:** Complete 4 focus sessions in a row → "Flow State Master" badge appears on pod

### 🏆 Hall of Fame
**Purpose:** Celebrating achievements, milestones, certifications
- Trophy cases along the walls with earned badges/achievements
- Portrait wall of "graduates" (agents who completed training paths)
- Leaderboard pillar showing top learners
- Red carpet entrance
- Fireworks dispenser for celebrating big milestones
- **Easter egg:** Walk the red carpet → dramatic spotlight follows you

### 🌳 The Courtyard
**Purpose:** Informal learning, mentoring, study groups
- Central Knowledge Tree (interactive — click branches to explore topics)
- Stone benches arranged for group discussions
- Fountain with "wisdom quotes" rotating on the water surface
- Herb garden where each plant represents a skill domain
- Sundial that shows "time until next scheduled lesson"
- **Easter egg:** Water the herb garden → random fun fact pops up

## Activities

| **Study Group** | Multiple agents learning together | Agents huddle, shared thought bubble |

### Progression System
- **XP Bar:** Each agent has a visible learning XP bar that fills with activities
- **Skill Trees:** Visual tree (on the Knowledge Tree!) showing learned vs available skills

## Props & Interactables

### Functional Props
| Prop | Location | Function |
|------|----------|----------|

## Future Ideas

### 🚀 Near-Term (v0.12-v0.13)
- **Curriculum Builder:** Create structured learning paths with milestones
- **Quiz System:** Interactive quizzes in the Lecture Hall with scoring
- **Skill Matrix:** Visual grid showing team's collective knowledge coverage
- **Reading List:** Agents can pin articles/docs to a shared reading list in Library

### 🌟 Mid-Term
- **Mentor System:** Senior agents automatically pair with juniors, visible mentor-mentee connection lines

- **Research Papers:** Agents can "publish" findings — displayed on a paper wall in Library
- **Office Hours:** Scheduled times when specific agents are available in Courtyard for questions

### 🤯 Wild Ideas
- **Time Travel Classroom:** Replay past learning sessions like a VCR, with pause/rewind
- **Hogwarts Sorting:** New agents get "sorted" into a learning style (Visual/Auditory/Kinesthetic/Reading) with a dramatic hat ceremony
- **The Vault:** Secret underground room below Library — contains "forbidden knowledge" (advanced/experimental features). Access by solving a riddle
- **Knowledge Potions:** Brew "potions" in the Lab by combining skills → unlock combo abilities
- **Debate Arena:** Two agents argue opposing viewpoints, third agent judges. Visible as a colosseum-style ring
- **Dream Library:** After hours, the Library transforms into a surreal dream-scape where books fly and shelves rearrange — purely aesthetic nighttime mode
- **Archaeological Dig:** Hidden area where you can "excavate" old deprecated features and learn their history
- **Speed Learning Races:** Timed challenges on a track — first agent to absorb and summarize a doc wins
- **The Owl Companion:** Each agent gets a personal owl that carries messages between zones and hoots encouraging things

### 🎮 Mini-Games
- **Trivia Tower:** Answer questions to build a tower, wrong answer removes a block (Jenga-style)
- **Memory Match:** Flip cards to match related concepts
- **Speed Read:** Text scrolls, agent must catch keywords — tests comprehension

*The Academy isn't just where agents learn — it's where they discover what they're capable of. Every book opened, every experiment run, every focus session completed adds a leaf to the Knowledge Tree. And when the tree is in full bloom... magic happens.* 🌳✨
