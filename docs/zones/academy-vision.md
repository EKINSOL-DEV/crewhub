# 🎓 Academy — Zone Vision Document

*Where curiosity goes to level up and knowledge becomes superpower.*

## Vision

The Academy is CrewHub's knowledge hub — a sprawling campus where agents learn, teach, document, and grow. Picture Hogwarts meets MIT meets a cozy public library. It's not just about storing information; it's about making knowledge **alive, interactive, and fun**.

**Core vibe:** Scholarly but not stuffy. Think warm wood, floating books, ambient candlelight mixed with holographic displays. Ancient wisdom meets cutting-edge tech.

**Who works here:** WTL (Waterleau knowledge agent), any agent doing research, documentation, onboarding, or deep analysis. Also serves as the onboarding zone for new agents joining CrewHub.

## Environment

### Aesthetic
- **Toon-shaded** with warm ambers, deep mahogany browns, and pops of emerald green
- **Lighting:** Warm candlelight (floating candles! 🕯️) mixed with soft blue holographic glows from knowledge displays
- **Ambient mood:** Quiet. Occasional page-turning sounds. A grandfather clock ticking somewhere
- **Weather:** Perpetual autumn outside the windows — golden leaves drifting past, warm light

### Layout
The Academy is built like a university campus quad. A central **Courtyard** with a fountain connects all buildings. Ivy grows on the walls. Pathways are lined with lanterns that glow at night.

### Special Effects
- **Floating Books** — Books lazily orbit around the Library ceiling, occasionally opening to show relevant snippets
- **Knowledge Particles** — When an agent learns something new, golden particles spiral upward like embers from a campfire
- **Ink Trails** — Agents leave faint calligraphy-style ink trails when walking through the Academy (fades after a few seconds)
- **Wisdom Tree** — Central courtyard has a massive tree with glowing leaves. Each leaf represents a documented knowledge item. The tree grows over time!

### 5. 🧘 The Study Garden
**Purpose:** Quiet focus work, reading, contemplation

- Outdoor room (open-air in the courtyard)
- Stone benches around the Wisdom Tree
- Koi pond with gentle water animation
- Wind chimes (visual only — small props swaying)

- Zen sand garden (rake marks change daily)
- Bird occasionally lands on tree branch

**Activities:**
- Focused reading sessions
- Quiet documentation work
- Meditation / agent "rest" between heavy tasks
- Brainstorming in nature
- Knowledge review and reflection

### 6. 🎓 The Onboarding Chamber
**Purpose:** New agent welcome, setup, orientation

- Welcome mat at entrance ("Welcome, New Agent!")
- Tutorial screens on walls (step-by-step guides)
- Wardrobe/closet where agents "pick" their appearance
- Mirror showing agent's current stats/config
- Starter kit box on desk (glowing)
- Certificate frame on wall (empty, fills when onboarding completes)
- Buddy bench where existing agents can sit to mentor

**Activities:**
- New agent onboarding wizard
- Configuration and personalization
- Role assignment
- First-task walkthrough
- Meeting the team

## Future Ideas

### 🤯 Wild & Wonderful

1. **Knowledge Graph 3D** — The Map Room table displays an actual 3D knowledge graph. Nodes are topics, edges are relationships. You can fly through it, zoom into clusters, see what's connected. It's like a brain made visible.

2. **Skill Trees** — Each agent has a literal RPG-style skill tree displayed in the Lecture Hall. As they complete tasks in different domains, skills unlock and branches grow. Visual progression system!
   - 🌱 Novice → 🌿 Practitioner → 🌳 Expert → 🌟 Master
   - Branching paths: "Documentation" → "Technical Writing" → "API Docs Specialist"

3. **The Archives** — A secret basement level under the Library. Dark, dusty, with old filing cabinets. Contains historical data, deprecated docs, and "ancient knowledge." Accessible via a hidden bookshelf door (pull the red book to open).

4. **Study Buddy System** — New agents get paired with experienced ones. Their desks physically appear next to each other in the Study Garden. Thought bubbles show them exchanging knowledge.

5. **The Exam Room** — Agents can take "quizzes" generated from the knowledge base. Correct answers trigger fireworks, wrong answers trigger a gentle "try again" animation. Scores displayed on a leaderboard.

6. **Memory Palace** — A special room where agent memory files are visualized as physical objects in a room. Each memory is a floating crystal you can "touch" to see its content. The room fills up over time. Beautiful and functional!

7. **Library Card System** — Each agent gets a library card that tracks:
   - Docs read 📚
   - Docs written ✍️
   - Knowledge shared 🎤
   - Questions answered 💡
   - Displayed on a card that sits on their desk

8. **The Observatory** — A rooftop room with a telescope. "Looking at the stars" = monitoring external trends, competitor analysis, industry news. The night sky shows constellations that map to different tech domains.

9. **Easter Egg: Sorting Hat** — When a new agent enters the Onboarding Chamber, a sorting hat appears and "assigns" them to their zone with dramatic flair. Pure Harry Potter energy. 🎩

10. **Time Capsule** — Buried in the courtyard. Every month, agents can contribute a note to the capsule. After 6 months, it "opens" and shows what everyone was thinking about back then. Nostalgia machine.

### 🔮 Future Technical Features

- **Auto-Documentation** — Agents in the Research Lab auto-generate documentation from code analysis
- **Knowledge Search** — Library search interface powered by RAG over all project docs
- **Onboarding Automation** — Onboarding Chamber actually runs the setup wizard in 3D
- **WTL Integration** — WTL agent's Waterleau knowledge visible as a dedicated bookshelf section
- **Learning Paths** — Curated sequences of tasks that teach agents new skills
- **Spaced Repetition** — Knowledge items resurface periodically for review (like Anki but spatial)
