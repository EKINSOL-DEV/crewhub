# 🎬 Creator Center — Zone Vision Document

*Where pixels meet passion and content comes alive.*

## Vision

The Creator Center is CrewHub's creative powerhouse — a buzzing media studio complex where agents craft, edit, publish, and brainstorm content. Think Pixar campus meets YouTube HQ meets a neon-lit Tokyo design studio. The vibe is **electric, colorful, and slightly chaotic** — whiteboards covered in sticky notes, screens playing previews, coffee cups everywhere.

This is where Flowy and Creator live. It's their domain. Other agents visit to collaborate, but the creative energy here is unmistakable.

**Core philosophy:** *Every piece of content starts as a spark. This zone is the kindling.*

## Environment

### Visual Style
- **Toon-shaded** with extra vibrant saturation — colors pop more here than anywhere else
- **Neon accent lighting** — soft pink/purple/cyan glow strips along walls and desks
- **Large windows** with animated cityscapes or nature timelapses as "inspiration views"
- **Floor:** Polished concrete with paint splatters (procedural shader — each room unique)
- **Walls:** Exposed brick + cork boards with pinned concept art

### Ambient Details
- Floating holographic mood boards that slowly rotate
- A vintage film projector in the hallway casting animated light patterns on the wall
- Plants (lots of them) — hanging ferns, desk succulents, a big fiddle leaf fig
- Lo-fi beats visual: a tiny animated vinyl record player on a shelf, needle moving
- Random inspirational quotes that change daily on a digital wall sign

### Weather/Time Integration
- Morning: warm golden light floods through windows
- Night: neon strips intensify, screens glow brighter, cozy "late night editing" vibe
- When an agent is in "deep work": lights dim slightly, a subtle "recording" red light appears

## Rooms

### 🎥 Studio A — The Main Stage
**Purpose:** Video & visual content production
- Green screen wall (toggleable)
- Ring light prop (glows when agent is "recording")
- Camera on tripod (rotates to follow active agent)
- Teleprompter screen showing current task text
- Director's chair with agent name embroidered
- **Easter egg:** Click the clapperboard 3 times → confetti explosion + movie quote toast

### 🎨 Design Lab — The Pixel Forge
**Purpose:** Graphics, thumbnails, branding work
- Giant Wacom-style tablet prop on desk (shows mini preview of recent designs)
- Color palette wall — physical color swatches that match the current project's brand colors
- Pantone mug (it's always a Pantone mug)
- Dual ultrawide monitors showing "work in progress"
- Mood board wall with drag-droppable inspiration images
- **Easter egg:** The Pantone mug color changes to match the most-used color in recent designs

### 🎙️ Podcast Booth — The Sound Cave
**Purpose:** Audio content, voice work, podcast recording
- Acoustic foam walls (hexagonal pattern, dark gray/purple)
- Professional mic on boom arm
- Headphones hanging on hook
- Sound wave visualizer on wall (reacts to agent activity)
- "ON AIR" sign above door (lights up during active tasks)

### 📱 Social Command — Mission Control
**Purpose:** Social media management, scheduling, analytics
- Wall of screens showing "live feeds" (animated placeholder dashboards)
- World clock showing multiple timezones
- Engagement counter (animated numbers ticking up)
- Content calendar whiteboard (syncs with actual scheduled posts if connected)
- Notification bell that physically rings when mentions come in

### ✍️ Writers' Room — The Word Womb
**Purpose:** Copywriting, blog posts, scripts, brainstorming
- Long table with scattered papers and coffee cups
- Classic typewriter prop (animated key presses when agent writes)
- Bookshelf wall with actual book titles from a curated list
