# 🎬 Creator Center — Zone Vision Document

*Where ideas become reality, and every pixel tells a story.*

## Vision

The Creator Center is CrewHub's creative powerhouse — a vibrant, buzzing studio complex where agents craft content, edit media, brainstorm campaigns, and produce everything from social posts to full video productions. Think Pixar's campus meets a cyberpunk coworking space.

**Vibe:** Electric creativity. Neon accents. Screens everywhere showing live previews. The sound of keyboards clacking and ideas sparking. A place where Flowy and Creator feel *at home*.

**Core philosophy:** Creation is messy, collaborative, and fun. The space should reflect that — whiteboards with half-finished sketches, coffee cups on desks, sticky notes everywhere.

## Environment

### Toon-Shaded Aesthetic
- **Color palette:** Deep purples, electric blues, hot pink accents, with warm orange task lights
- **Lighting:** Dramatic — spotlights on workstations, soft ambient glow from screens, neon strip lights along walls
- **Floor:** Dark polished concrete with paint splatter decals (toon-shaded, of course)
- **Walls:** Exposed brick texture mixed with digital display panels showing rotating content
- **Ceiling:** Industrial with exposed beams, hanging studio lights, and cable runs

### Atmosphere Details
- Floating holographic mood boards that slowly rotate above desks
- A giant LED wall at the entrance cycling through recent creations
- Ambient particles: tiny sparkles/stars floating in creative rooms (like dust in sunbeams)
- Weather system: the zone's "sky" (visible through skylights) changes based on creative output — sunny when productive, aurora borealis during brainstorm sessions

## Rooms

### 🎙️ The Studio
**Purpose:** Video and audio production hub
- Green screen wall (toggleable)
- Podcast desk with 3 mic positions
- Camera rig on a mini track
- Soundproofing panels on walls (wavy acoustic foam, toon-shaded)
- **Easter egg:** Click the "ON AIR" sign 5 times → disco lights activate

### 🎨 Design Lab
**Purpose:** Visual design, image generation, brand work
- Large drawing tablets on desks (glow when active)
- Color wheel prop that spins when an agent is generating images
- Inspiration wall with pinned references (pulls from actual project assets)
- Pantone swatch tower in the corner
- **Easter egg:** Drag a color from the color wheel onto a bot → temporarily changes their color

### 📝 Content Forge
**Purpose:** Writing, copywriting, social media content
- Cozy writer's nook with armchair and lamp
- Typewriter prop on a vintage desk (keys animate when writing)
- Word cloud floating above the room showing trending topics
- Stack of "published" documents that grows over time
- **Easter egg:** The typewriter occasionally goes "DING!" with a little bell animation

### 📊 Campaign HQ
**Purpose:** Marketing strategy, analytics, campaign management
- War room table with holographic campaign dashboards
- Timeline wall showing campaign milestones
- Competitor radar display (rotating dish on roof)
- Whiteboard with strategy diagrams
- **Easter egg:** Tap the radar dish → it beeps and shows "NO COMPETITORS DETECTED" 😎

### ☕ The Lounge
**Purpose:** Informal brainstorming, breaks, creative recharging
- Bean bags and low tables
- Arcade cabinet in the corner (playable mini-game?)
- Vending machine with "Creative Fuel" branding
- Plant wall (living green wall, toon-shaded)
- Record player with vinyl spinning when music "plays"
- **Easter egg:** Interact with the vending machine → random creative prompt appears
