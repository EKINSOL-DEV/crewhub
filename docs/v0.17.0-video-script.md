**Hero feature:** Streaming Chat (real-time SSE token streaming)
**Target length:** 60–90 seconds
**Format:** Screen recording + on-screen captions, no voiceover
**Tone:** Clean, modern, confident — product demo, not tutorial

---

## Shot List

---

### Shot 1 — The Problem (Before)
**Duration:** ~8s
**Scene:** Chat UI with a normal (non-streaming) response. User sends a message → spinner appears → long pause → full response pops in all at once. No life, no feedback.

**On screen:**
- Chat window, user sends a message (something like: *"Explain async/await in JavaScript"*)
- Loading spinner visible for 3–4 seconds
- Full block of text appears suddenly

**Caption overlay:**
> `Old behavior: wait… wait… boom. All at once.`

**Recording tip:** Use a real AI crew that takes a moment to respond. The pause is the point — let it breathe. Don't cut it short.

---

### Shot 2 — The Reveal (After: Streaming Enabled)
**Duration:** ~12s
**Scene:** Same type of message sent, but now text streams in token by token — smooth, live, like watching someone type in real-time.

**On screen:**
- User sends the same message
- Text immediately starts appearing, character by character / token by token
- Cursor blinks at the end of the streaming text

**Caption overlay:**
> `v0.17.0: Streaming chat. Live. Token by token.`

**Recording tip:** Pick a message that produces a medium-length response (5–8 sentences). Long enough to show the effect clearly, short enough to fit the shot. Zoom in slightly so the streaming text is readable.

---

### Shot 3 — Auto-Scroll in Action
**Duration:** ~8s
**Scene:** A longer streaming response — the chat window auto-scrolls down as new tokens arrive. The user doesn't touch anything — it just follows.

**On screen:**
- Chat window with a long response actively streaming
- Visible auto-scroll: the viewport moves down naturally as content grows
- No user interaction

**Caption overlay:**
> `Auto-scroll follows you. No manual scrolling needed.`

**Recording tip:** Use a prompt that generates a longer response (a list, a code snippet, step-by-step instructions). Make sure the chat window is tall enough that scrolling is clearly visible. Don't scroll yourself — let it happen.

---

### Shot 4 — Zen Mode
**Duration:** ~8s
**Scene:** Cut to Zen Mode (fullscreen chat). Clean, distraction-free. Start streaming a response — it flows beautifully in the full-screen layout.

**On screen:**
- Zen Mode open (fullscreen, minimal UI)
- A message is sent, streaming kicks in
- Text fills the full-width canvas

**Caption overlay:**
> `Zen Mode — fullscreen focus.`

**Recording tip:** Show the transition into Zen Mode briefly before sending the message, so viewers understand this is a different view. Keep the message short here — 3–5 seconds of streaming is enough.

---

### Shot 5 — Float Window
**Duration:** ~7s
**Scene:** The Float window (a floating chat panel, likely on top of another app or page). Streaming works here too — compact, live.

**On screen:**
- Float window visible, possibly overlapping a document or dashboard in the background
- Streaming response inside the float window

**Caption overlay:**
> `Float window — works everywhere.`

**Recording tip:** Have something visible behind the Float window (a doc, a dashboard) to show that it overlays your work. The contrast makes it look useful.

---

### Shot 6 — Mobile
**Duration:** ~8s
**Scene:** Mobile view of CrewHub. User sends a message on mobile, streaming response renders live on the smaller screen.

**On screen:**
- Mobile layout (narrow, stacked)
- Streaming response active
- Touch input visible (soft keyboard briefly, then dismissed)

**Caption overlay:**
> `Mobile. Same experience. Same speed.`

**Recording tip:** Record at 390×844 (iPhone viewport) or use browser dev tools mobile emulation if you don't have a real device handy. Make sure font size is readable at video resolution.

---

### Shot 7 — The Lineup / Recap
**Duration:** ~8s
**Scene:** Quick montage or split-screen showing all 3 UIs side by side (or rapid cuts): Zen Mode → Float → Mobile. All streaming simultaneously or in quick succession.

**On screen:**
- 3 UI variants with streaming active
- Labels on each: `Zen Mode` / `Float` / `Mobile`

**Caption overlay:**
> `All 3 chat UIs. All streaming. v0.17.0.`

**Recording tip:** If split-screen is too complex to edit, just do rapid 2-second cuts between each. The point is "it works everywhere" — the rhythm matters more than the layout.

---

### Shot 8 — End Card
**Duration:** ~6s
**Scene:** Clean end screen with logo, version number, and a CTA.

**On screen:**
- CrewHub logo or wordmark
- `v0.17.0` version badge
- One-liner summary text

**Caption overlay / static text:**
> `CrewHub v0.17.0`
> `Streaming chat. Everywhere.`
> `→ crewhub.app` *(or your actual URL)*

**Recording tip:** Keep this static — no animation needed unless you have a template. Just clean and readable.

---

## Optional: v0.17.0 Other Improvements

If you want to tack on a 10-second "also in this release" section after Shot 7 and before the end card:

**Caption overlay:**
> `Also in v0.17.0:`
> `— Mobile layout improvements`
> `— Desktop app updates`
> `— Bug fixes & performance`

Show a quick flash of the mobile UI or desktop app icon — no need for a full demo.

## Recording Tips (General)

### ✅ Do
- Use a **real conversation** — send an actual message to an AI crew that produces a varied, interesting response
- Keep your **cursor off-screen** or still during streaming shots — movement is distracting
- Record at **1920×1080 or 2x retina** (2560×1440 downscaled) for crispness
- Use a **dark/neutral browser theme** if possible — less visual noise
- **Trim aggressively** — each shot should start right as the action happens
- Add a **subtle zoom-in** (5–10%) on streaming shots so text is clearly readable
- Record **audio-off** — no keyboard clicks, no notifications

### ❌ Avoid
- Don't show **loading errors, API timeouts, or broken states** — reset and re-record
- Don't show **your bookmarks bar, personal tabs, or notifications**
- Avoid **long pauses** where nothing is happening (unless it's the intentional "before" shot)
- Don't **demo-talk** to the camera — this is a visual product demo, let the UI speak
- Avoid **lorem ipsum** or fake content — use real AI responses, it looks more credible

---

## Suggested Caption Style

- Font: **Inter** or system sans-serif, bold
- Position: **Lower third** (bottom 20% of screen)
- Style: Dark pill background, white text — or white text with drop shadow
- Timing: Caption appears 0.3s after shot starts, fades 0.3s before shot ends

---

## Total Runtime Estimate

| Shot | Duration |
|------|----------|
| 1 — Before (spinner) | 8s |
| 2 — After (streaming reveal) | 12s |
| 3 — Auto-scroll | 8s |
| 4 — Zen Mode | 8s |
| 5 — Float window | 7s |
| 6 — Mobile | 8s |
| 7 — Lineup/recap | 8s |
| 8 — End card | 6s |
| **Total** | **~65s** ✅ |

> Optional "also in v0.17.0" section adds ~10s → ~75s total. Still within 90s.
