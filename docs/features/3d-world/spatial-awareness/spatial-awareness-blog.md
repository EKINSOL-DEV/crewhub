# Spatial Awareness Research

*Date: 2026-02-13*  
*Feature: Spatial Awareness*  
*Version: v0.15.0 (Research Phase)*

## What & Why

[Vision for spatial awareness in CrewHub - what it means for agents to "see" and navigate]

## The Vision

[Big picture - agents that understand their 3D environment, detect proximity, navigate paths]

## Research Findings

[What technologies and approaches were explored]

### Vision (Raycasting)
[Findings on Three.js raycasting for line-of-sight]

### Proximity Detection
[Approaches for detecting nearby agents/objects]

### Pathfinding
[Libraries and algorithms explored (A*, navmesh, etc.)]

## Technical Approach

[High-level architecture design]

## Prototype Results

[If a prototype was built - what works, what doesn't]

## Challenges

[Technical challenges discovered during research]

## Next Steps

[Roadmap for full implementation]
