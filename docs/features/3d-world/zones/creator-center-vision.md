# 🎬 Creator Center — Zone Vision Document

*Where ideas become pixels, sounds, and stories.*

## Vision

The Creator Center is CrewHub's creative powerhouse — a vibrant, colorful zone where content gets made, edited, reviewed, and published. Think of it as a digital film studio meets design agency meets podcast booth, all wrapped in toon-shaded glory.

**Vibe:** Energetic, inspiring, slightly chaotic (in the best way). Neon accents, mood boards everywhere, half-finished projects scattered around. The kind of space where you walk in and immediately want to *make something*.

**Who lives here:** Creator agents, Flowy (PO/PM), content reviewers, anyone producing media.

## Environment

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Toon-shaded** with bold, saturated colors — purples, pinks, electric blues
- **Exposed brick walls** with graffiti-style murals (procedurally generated from project keywords!)
- **Floating holographic displays** showing live previews of work-in-progress content
- **Ambient music visualizer** — subtle audio-reactive particles in the background that pulse with "creative energy" (based on agent activity levels)
- **Time of day lighting**: warm golden hour during active creation, cool blue during review phases

### Signature Details
- A giant **inspiration wall** at the entrance — a 3D cork board with pinned screenshots, color palettes, and sticky notes from recent projects
- **Cable spaghetti** on the floor near the editing stations (because realism 😄)
- A **vending machine** that dispenses "Creative Fuel" (Easter egg: click it for random creative prompts)
- **Plants that grow** based on content output — more content = lusher plants

## Rooms

### 🎥 Studio Alpha — The Main Stage
The primary production room. A green screen wall, ring lights, camera rigs (as props), and a director's chair.

A cozy room packed with drawing tablets, color wheels, and reference boards.

A padded, acoustically-treated room with a podcast setup.
- **Purpose:** TTS generation, audio content, podcast scripts, voice-over work

- **Fun detail:** The soundwave visualizer actually responds to recent TTS output lengths

### ✏️ Writer's Nook — The Word Well
A quiet, book-lined corner with a vintage typewriter aesthetic (but modern).

- **Props:** Typewriter (animated key presses when agent is writing), stack of books, coffee mug (always full ☕)

### 👀 Review Room — The Crit Pit
A screening room with theater seats and a big display.

### 📦 Asset Vault — The Archive
A warehouse-style room with shelves of organized media files.

## Activities

### Content Creation Pipeline
1. **Brief drops** in the Studio → agents pick up tasks from the TaskBoard
2. **Creation** happens in specialized rooms (Design Lab for visuals, Sound Booth for audio, etc.)
3. **Review** in the Crit Pit — other agents or users give feedback
4. **Publish** — content gets "shipped" with a satisfying animation (confetti! 🎉)

### Collaborative Features
- **Mood Board Sync** — agents can pin references to a shared mood board visible in all rooms
- **Live Preview Wall** — the hallway shows thumbnails of all active projects
- **Creative Sprints** — timed creation challenges with a visible countdown timer in the zone

### Metrics & Gamification
- **Creator Leaderboard** — who produced the most content this week?
- **Quality Score** — based on review feedback
- **Streak Counter** — consecutive days with published content
- **Achievement Badges:** "First Publish", "10x Creator", "Night Owl" (created after midnight), "Speed Demon" (under 5 min)
