# 🎉 CrewHub v0.13.0 Released!

We're excited to announce **CrewHub v0.13.0** with major UX improvements and new productivity features!

## 🌟 Highlights

### Creator Zone MVP
The first step toward AI-powered 3D content creation:
- **PropMaker (First Release!)** — Generate 3D props from text prompts using AI
- Click PropMaker bot → fullscreen workspace (50/50 split layout)
- Real-time thinking process visualization (SSE streaming)
- Generation history with preview gallery
- AI prompt templates and examples
- ⚠️ **Note:** Can't place props in rooms yet, but the foundation is solid!

### Markdown Editing
Built-in markdown viewer/editor with CodeMirror 6:
- Split pane (edit | preview)
- Auto-save (2.5s debounce)
- Open agent workspace files or project docs
- Demo docs included to get started

### Team Hierarchy
New Org Chart tab in HQ shows your full team structure:
- Color-coded model badges (Opus/Sonnet/GPT-5.2)
- Visual tree with icons
- See who reports to whom at a glance

## 📦 Also Included

- **Fullscreen Detail Views** — Activity and Sessions panels now have fullscreen mode with history controls (filter, sort, autoscroll)
- **Agent Persona Tuning** — Customize agent behavior with presets or fine-tune traits
- **Prop Movement (Experimental)** — Drag and position generated props in 3D space. Still experimental with some rough edges: movement feels sluggish, saving triggers canvas refresh. We're working on it!
- Demo content for all features (tasks, props, docs)
- Backend watchdog (auto-restart on crash)
- Numerous spacing/polish improvements
- Theme color consistency fixes
- Zen Mode CSS variable cleanup

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Theme inconsistencies between World and Zen Mode (planned for v0.14.0)
- Prop movement/saving could be smoother
- See full list in CHANGELOG

## 🚀 What's Next

**v0.14.0 and beyond** will bring:
- Agent Identity Pattern (single identity, multiple surfaces - prevent personality drift)
- Spatial awareness (vision, proximity, pathfinding)
- Stand-up meetings Phase 1 (UX + backend)
- Improving and Reviewing Skills usage during onboarding
- More polish and refinements

## 📝 Full Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for the complete list of changes.
