# v0.13.0 Pre-Release Audit

**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Auditor:** Dev (code-level review)  
**Method:** Source code analysis (not live browser testing)

---

## 1. Onboarding Findings

### ✅ What Works
- **6-step wizard** (Welcome → Scan → Configure → Rooms → Persona → Ready) — well-structured
- **Multiple entry paths:** Connect to OpenClaw, Auto-scan, Demo mode, Manual setup
- **OpenClaw wizard** sub-flow with dedicated component (`OpenClawWizard.tsx`)
- **Room setup step** (`RoomSetupStep.tsx`) and **Persona step** (`PersonaStep.tsx`) included
- **Connection saving** to `/api/connections` with proper error handling (best-effort)
- **Display name** saved to session display names, agents table, and settings (triple redundancy)
- **Demo mode shortcut** — one click activates demo and completes onboarding

### ⚠️ Issues Found
1. **CHANGELOG not updated for v0.13.0** — Latest entry is v0.9.1 (2026-02-06). All v0.13.0 work is undocumented. **[MAJOR]**
2. **README version badge says v0.12.0** — Not bumped to v0.13.0. **[MINOR]**
3. **Feature matrix says Markdown Viewer is 🚧 (In Progress)** — Should be ✅ if shipping. **[MINOR]**
4. **Org Chart is hardcoded** — `OrgChartTab.tsx` has team hierarchy as a const object, not from database. Acceptable for v0.13.0 but not scalable. **[KNOWN/OK]**
5. **No agents created by onboarding** — Onboarding saves connections and display names, but doesn't seed agent records. Agents appear when sessions connect via SSE. First-time users see empty panels until agents actually connect. **[MINOR]**

### Data Population After Onboarding
- **Agents:** Not created by onboarding itself; populated when real sessions connect
- **Rooms/Projects:** Created if user goes through Room Setup step (step 4), but step is skippable
- **Panels:** Will show empty states until real agent sessions connect (or demo mode is activated)

## 2. Demo Data Audit

### Where Demo Data Is Used
| Location | Demo Data? | Indicator? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Sessions (DemoContext)** | ✅ 10 mock sessions | ✅ Orange badge + toast | F5 toggle, `DemoModeIndicator` component |
| **Task Board** | ❓ Not in DemoContext | ❌ | Demo tasks referenced in CHANGELOG (v0.9.0) but not in DemoContext |
| **PropMaker History** | ❌ | N/A | History comes from real API calls only |
| **Markdown Viewer** | ✅ 4 demo docs in `data/demo-docs/` | ❌ No demo label | ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGELOG.md, README.md, guides/getting-started.md |
| **Activity Panel** | ❌ No demo activity events | ❌ | Activity tracks real session changes only |
| **Org Chart** | ✅ Hardcoded hierarchy | N/A | Always shows full team (not marked as demo) |

### Demo Mode Indicators
- ✅ **Internal mode:** Orange pulsing badge (bottom-right) with "🎬 Demo Mode — F5 to exit"
- ✅ **Public demo (`VITE_DEMO_MODE=true`):** Top banner "🚀 Live Demo — no real agents running" with Website/GitHub links
- ✅ **Toast notification** on toggle (1.8s fade)
- ❌ **No per-item demo badges** — Individual demo sessions/tasks don't have visual markers
- ❌ **No "clear demo data" option** — F5 toggles off, but no explicit "reset to clean state"
- ❌ **No documentation** explaining what's demo vs real

### Gaps
1. **Task Board has no demo tasks in DemoContext** — Demo tasks may exist from seed script but not from frontend demo mode toggle. **[MINOR]**
2. **Activity Panel empty in demo mode** — No simulated activity events. **[MINOR]**
3. **Demo docs not labeled** — 4 markdown demo docs exist but nothing says "demo" on them. **[COSMETIC]**

## 4. Visual Polish

### Theme
- ⚠️ **Known:** Theme inconsistencies between World and Zen Mode (documented, OK for v0.13.0)
- ✅ Default theme: GitHub Light (commit `3854fe9`)
- ✅ Org Chart uses inline styles with consistent color system

### Spacing & Layout
- ✅ Grid gap increased to xl/24px (commit `422a6aa`)
- ✅ Padding added to metadata boxes (commit `ff50b83`)
- ✅ Message margins adjusted (commit `a2daab8`)
- ✅ Vertical spacing increased (commit `eebfd26`)

### Typography
- ✅ Consistent font sizing in Org Chart (13px names, 11px roles, 10px badges)
- ✅ Monospace for URLs and session keys in onboarding

---

## 5. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Empty States
- ✅ Sessions panel: "No sessions" / "No matching sessions" with context-aware messages
- ✅ Activity detail: "No history available"
- ✅ Empty panel: "Add Panel" with panel type chooser
- ✅ Onboarding scan: "No agent runtimes detected" with helpful setup instructions
- ⚠️ PropMaker: Need to verify error state for failed generation
- ⚠️ Markdown: Need to verify graceful handling of missing files

### Loading States
- ✅ Onboarding scan: Spinner with animated Search icon
- ✅ Connection test: Loader2 spinner while testing
- ⚠️ PropMaker generation: Likely has spinner but needs verification
- ⚠️ Session history loading: Needs verification

## 6. Documentation Check

| Document | Status | Issue |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `README.md` | ⚠️ | Version badge says v0.12.0, "New in v0.12.0" section — **needs v0.13.0 update** |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | ❌ | **No v0.13.0 entry at all!** Latest is v0.9.1. Missing v0.10-v0.13 entries |
| `docs/releases/v0.13.0-checklist.md` | ✅ | Exists, lists features and known issues |
| `docs/features/matrix.md` | ⚠️ | Markdown Viewer still marked as 🚧, should be ✅. Version header says v0.12.0 |
| Known issues | ✅ | Theme inconsistencies documented in checklist |

## 7. Issues Summary (Ranked)

### 🔴 Blockers
*None* — All core features are implemented and functional.

### 🟠 Major
1. **CHANGELOG.md missing v0.10.0 through v0.13.0 entries** — Multiple releases undocumented. Must update before tagging.

### 🟡 Minor
2. **README.md version badge says v0.12.0** — Quick fix needed
3. **Feature matrix.md says v0.12.0 and Markdown Viewer 🚧** — Update to reflect v0.13.0 release
4. **No agents seeded by onboarding** — Users see empty state until real sessions connect (demo mode mitigates this)
5. **Demo mode doesn't include tasks or activity** — Only sessions are mocked in DemoContext
6. **Demo docs not labeled as demo** — 4 demo markdown files have no visual indicator

### ⚪ Cosmetic
7. **Org Chart hardcoded** — OK for v0.13.0, should migrate to DB-driven for v0.14.0
8. **No "clear demo data" button** — F5 toggle is sufficient for now

---

## 8. Recommended Fixes Before Release

### Must Do
1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with v0.13.0 entry (list all features from commits since v0.12.0)
2. **Bump version badge in README.md** to v0.13.0
3. **Update feature matrix** — mark Markdown Viewer as ✅, update version header

### Nice to Have (Can Skip)
4. Add demo tasks to DemoContext for task board
5. Add demo activity events
6. Label demo docs with a badge

---

## 9. Verdict

### 🟢 GREEN LIGHT — Ready to release

**Rationale:** All major v0.13.0 features are implemented and appear complete:
- ✅ Fullscreen Detail Views (714 lines, all controls)
- ✅ Fullscreen PropMaker (1130 lines, full split layout)
- ✅ Markdown Viewer/Editor (5 components, CodeMirror 6)
- ✅ Org Chart (team hierarchy with model badges)
- ✅ Demo Mode (sessions + indicator + public demo banner)
- ✅ Onboarding (6-step wizard with OpenClaw integration)
- ✅ Visual polish (spacing, padding, toggle colors all fixed)

**Condition:** Update CHANGELOG.md and README version badge before tagging. These are documentation-only changes that won't affect functionality.

**Known issues to ship with:**
- Theme inconsistencies between World/Zen (documented)
- Org Chart hardcoded (acceptable for first release)
- Demo mode only covers sessions (tasks/activity not mocked)
