# 🎉 CrewHub v0.14.0 Released!

Big update dropping today — **v0.14.0** brings a cleaner Zen Mode architecture and hands-on prop editing!

## 🌟 Highlights

### PropMaker Part Editor ✂️
The most requested PropMaker feature is here — **edit individual parts** of your generated props:
- **Select any sub-object** — click a mesh part to highlight it
- **Transform controls** — scale, rotate, and reposition each part independently
- **Fine-tune AI output** — AI generates the base, you perfect the details
- **Non-destructive** — original prop preserved, edits layered on top

### PropMaker Quality Phase 2-3 🎨
Significant improvements to prop generation quality:
- **Component library** — 7 reusable animated parts (LED, Steam, GlowOrb, Cable, DataStream, Screen, RotatingPart)
- **Multi-pass generation** — Iterative refinement for better results
- **Style transfer** — Apply visual styles across props
- **Hybrid generation** — Combine AI generation with manual tweaks
- **Quality scorer** — Automatic quality assessment and optimization

### URL Parameter Zen Mode (`?mode=zen`)
Zen Mode just got a major upgrade. Instead of a separate standalone app, you now access it via a simple URL parameter:
- **One URL, two modes** — add `?mode=zen` to switch instantly
- **Cleaner architecture** — no duplicate routing, shared state, single entry point
- **Full Project CRUD** — Create, edit, and delete projects directly in Zen Mode (was broken before, now fully working)
- **Seamless switching** — World button takes you back to 3D, Zen button takes you to focus mode

## 📦 Also Included

- **Dev Error Logger** — Built-in debugging overlay with error tracking, stack traces, and persistent log viewer (dev-only)
- **Bot Animation Refactor** — Cleaner code architecture with dedicated animation modules
- **Grid Improvements** — Floor props now snap flush against walls
- **Prop Refiner Cleanup** — Simplified and streamlined refinement workflow

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed HMR-breaking export that caused hot reload failures
- Fixed camera controller interference with fullscreen overlays
- Fixed prop movement (faster long-press, no premature cancel)
- Fixed 3D view flicker issues
- Fixed Zen Mode chat context handling
- Cleaned up redundant Prop Refiner code

## 🚀 What's Next

**v0.15.0** will focus on:
- Grid boundary fine-tuning
- Agent Identity Pattern (single identity, multiple surfaces)
- Spatial awareness (vision, proximity, pathfinding)
- More polish and refinements
