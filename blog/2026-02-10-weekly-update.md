# CrewHub Weekly Update — February 10, 2026

*Week 1: From Zero to Living Campus*

---

## 🏗️ Building Something Different

Eight days ago, CrewHub didn't exist. Today, it's a living, breathing world where AI agents roam a toon-shaded campus, walk between rooms, and collaborate on projects.

We built CrewHub to solve a simple problem: **watching your AI agents work shouldn't feel like reading server logs**. If you're running multiple coding agents—whether it's OpenClaw, Claude Code, or Codex—you need a way to see what they're doing, where they're stuck, and how they're progressing. Most dashboards give you cards and tables. We wanted something better.

## 🌍 The 3D World That Started It All

CrewHub's signature feature is its **3D campus**. Your agents aren't just rows in a database—they're animated characters that walk, work, and wander. Zoom in to watch a coding agent type on a laptop. Pull back to see your entire fleet at once. Click a room to see the project task board rendered in 3D.

It's not about flashy graphics (though the toon-shading *is* nice). It's about **making abstract work visible**. When your agent is stuck, you see it standing still. When a task completes, they walk to a new room. The 3D world turns invisible progress into something you can *see*.

## 🎯 What We Built This Week

In 8 days, we shipped **12 releases** with **23 features** in various stages:

### ✅ Shipped This Week
- **Agent Persona Tuning** — Customize how agents behave (autonomous vs. cautious, detailed vs. concise)
- **Task Management** — Visual Kanban boards embedded in 3D rooms
- **Zen Mode** — Distraction-free focus mode with multi-tab workspaces
- **Modding System** — Editable templates (JSON blueprints) for custom props and rooms
- **Room Projects** — Organize agents by project, HQ command center for overview
- **Prop Drag & Drop** — Fixed edge cases, camera now stays still during prop movement

### 🚧 In Progress
- **Creator Zone MVP** — We prototyped an AI-assisted prop maker overnight (chat to generate 3D objects, live preview)
- **Zones Groundwork** — Foundation for themed campus areas (Creator Center, Academy, Game Center coming in v0.16.0)

## 🚀 What's Coming Next

Here's the roadmap for the next few releases:

**v0.13.0** (next) — Markdown viewer/editor, Creator Zone polish  
**v0.14.0** — Spatial awareness research (can agents "see" each other?), Stand-up meetings  
**v0.15.0** — HQ visual redesign  
**v0.16.0** — Full zones system (Academy + Game Center)  
**v0.17.0+** — Voice chat, Agent Teams support

## 🎨 Why Open Source?

CrewHub is **AGPL-3.0**. In plain terms:
- ✅ Free to use, modify, and deploy
- ✅ Community can build on top
- ❌ If you run a modified hosted version, you must publish those changes (keeps it open for everyone)

We're sharing the journey—design docs, mistakes, learnings—because we think AI tooling should be open. There's a [live demo](https://demo.crewhub.dev) if you want to try it without installing anything.
